This Java console application produces a combination of results which are obtained from 2 different ExpertSender endPoints, something some people came to require it to be done with a single endPoint.

Firstly, for a given range of dates, for the selected business unit, it obtains a list of sent newsletters. After getting this list, for each individual newsletter, statistics are obtained (Sends, Opens, Clicks, etc.). To finish off, an Excel spreadsheet is generated locally with both results properly organized. 

With this application, it is also possible to know how many newsletters were sent during the chosen period.
